## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This challenge I worked with React hooks _(useState)_ and get the understand how to deal with hooks.
- Using grid and flex layout acheive the responsiveness of the webpage.
- Tailwind has many features we can get better outcomes, one of the is _fill_ which is used with svg tags. In this challenge I have to add hover effects on social media icons. Firstly I used ``` <img/> ``` to include those icons. But, when we use that tag we were not able to change the color of svg with _fill_. Then we need to use ``` <svg></svg> ``` instead of ``` <img/> ```.

### Continued development

I will explore more about React features and using tailwind with optimal way.
